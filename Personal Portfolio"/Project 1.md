<p>In shadows deep, a soul does creep
Beneath the mask of deceit does it weep
A heart so numb, consumed by greed
A cheap facade, where no light can lead
  
![Unknown](mrcrabs.jpg)

Yet with a flicker in the dark
A spark of hope, a distant spark
May pierce the veil, may mend the seam
And redeem the broken dream

For even in the depths of night
There's still a chance to make things right
To rise above the darkness deep
And into the light, finally, to leap
</p>

<p>In the world of give and take
A balance must be found
Yet some hearts are quick to break
When pressures do abound

For those who freely give their all
Are often taken for granted
Their worth diminished, standing tall
Their spirit, empty, ranted

But let not the weight of expectation
Dim the light within your soul
For true worth lies in liberation
From others' harsh control

So stand firm, be true to self
And let no pressure bind
For in your worth, in your wealth
Your freedom, you will find.

Your freedom, you will find.
